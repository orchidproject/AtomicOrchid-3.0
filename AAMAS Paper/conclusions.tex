\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
\noindent In this paper we developed a novel approach to integrate and evaluate agent-based coordination algorithms to allocate teams of emergency responders in dynamic and uncertain environments.  In particular, we carried out field-trials of a task planning agent using a mixed-reality game  called AtomicOrchid in order to focus on the issues that arise in human-agent collaboration in team coordination. Results from the field trials indicate that  the planning agent produced and instructed players to carry out successful plans (outperforming a no-agent setting in terms of tasks completed and responders unharmed). The agent's ability to re-plan  according to responders' preferences and constraints was particularly effective. Finally our results lead us to suggest that systems involving human-agent collaboration should be adaptive, involve simple  interactions between humans and agents, and allow for flexible autonomy. Future work will look at running AtomicOrchid with expert responders and  exploring different interactional arrangements of humans and agents, in particular where control may be distributed across the team.\vspace{-1mm}
